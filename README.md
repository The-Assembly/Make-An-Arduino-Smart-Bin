# Make-An-Arduino-Smart-Bin
In this session, we'll use Arduino and servo motors + ultrasonic sensors to transform a regular dustbin into a smart device with a lid that opens automatically for a set time interval when an item is brought near it for disposal. This removes the need for any physical contact and the use of mechanical levers operated by hand/foot.     

Prerequisites: 
—Download the Arduino IDE (https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)  

Hardware Required: 
—Arduino UNO 
—Ultrasonic sensor 
—Servo motor 
—Jumper cables
